# customer_maintenance

Customer maintenance encompasses activities like adding new customers to a database, updating their information, and removing outdated records.

This repository contains a small Next.js application in `customer-app/` using TypeScript and a NestJS backend in `customer-api/`.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
cd customer-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/customers` to access the customer maintenance page.

### Backend

Start the API server:

```bash
cd customer-api
npm install
npm run start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.
